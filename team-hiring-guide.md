5. **People who make YOU better**

## 🎯 INTERVIEW BEST PRACTICES

### Before Interview
- [ ] Review résumé thoroughly

- [ ] Look for passion, not perfection
- [ ] Listen more than talk

## 🚫 COMMON HIRING MISTAKES

### 1. Hiring Too Fast
**Problem:** Desperate for help, hire first candidate
**Solution:** Wait for the right person, even if it takes longer

### 2. Settling
**Problem:** "They're not perfect, but good enough"
**Solution:** No "good enough" for early hires. They set the bar.

### 3. Not Selling Hard Enough
**Problem:** Interview felt like interrogation
**Solution:** Sell them on vision, mission, opportunity

### 4. Ignoring Culture Fit
**Problem:** Great skills, but wrong values
**Solution:** Skills can be learned, culture fit can't

### 5. Taking Too Long
**Problem:** Week 3 of "we'll get back to you"
**Solution:** Fast decisions = you respect their time + you're decisive
